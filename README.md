# Feature Engineering of The Diabetes Dataset


# Business Problem

It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have
diabetes when their characteristics are specified.
In this project, necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps will be performed
before model development.


# About the Data Set

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases
in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix,the 5th
largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.
The target variable is specified as "outcome";
1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

 Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies

 Glucose: 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test

 BloodPressure: Diastolic Blood Pressure (mm Hg)

 SkinThickness: Thickness of Skin

 Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

 DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that calculates the probability of having diabetes according to the descendants

 BMI: Body Mass Index

 Age: Age (year)

 Outcome: Diabetic ( 1 or 0 )
